Question: 
1. What happens if users choose “Cancel”?:  Canceling this dialog will cancel the launch.
2.	How to customize the options to users, e.g. only two options: “Yes” and “No”, OR “I do”
and “I don’t” 
- modify the "int option" section to: 

int option = JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog(null, 
		"Do you want to change to first class ticket?", null, JOptionPane.YES_NO_OPTION);
